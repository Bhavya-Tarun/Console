        <h1>Console</h1>
        <h3> Console is used to draft the code in HTML for real life example- We do all the calculations while doing maths 
            in rough before writing the answer in the main page. In the same way, we do all the calculations in console 
            so that their is no mistake in the html. For eg- We want to find the length of a word, we will write the code 
            in console for it to calculate and it will give us the answer at the live page's console. Console is written after 
            the body, in the script tag, in short- Console is like JS(Java Script). for printing anything in console itself we used
            console.log(variable). It is a better way to store the calculations in a variable and then print the variable. To see it,
            right click on the page- go to inspect- go to the code section to see how it works- and then go to console to see the results.
